# AR-Enhanced E-Learning Platform

An innovative AR-based e-learning platform designed to revolutionize the digital learning experience. By seamlessly integrating augmented reality (AR) with AI-driven interactivity, this project transforms traditional e-learning into a dynamic, immersive classroom-like environment.

## Overview

The AR-Enhanced E-Learning Platform brings together cutting-edge technologies to deliver a multi-sensory educational experience:
- **3D Virtual Teacher:** A realistic 3D model that interacts with students by writing on a virtual whiteboard and providing verbal explanations.
- **Real-Time AI Responses:** An integrated AI module generates contextually relevant answers to student queries instantly.
- **Voice Synthesis:** Utilizes Google Text-to-Speech for auditory learning, ensuring that students not only see but also hear explanations.
- **Augmented Reality Integration:** Leveraging Unity and ARCore, the platform overlays interactive AR content into the userâ€™s real-world environment.
- **Robust Backend:** A Node.js and Express-based backend, complemented by Firebase for secure, scalable data management.

This project addresses the limitations of traditional e-learning by providing an engaging, personalized, and immersive learning environment that adapts to the needs of diverse learners.

## Features

- **Immersive Learning:** Engage with educational content through interactive 3D models and AR visualizations.
- **Dynamic Classroom Simulation:** Experience a virtual classroom environment with a 3D teacher who responds to real-time queries.
- **Multi-Sensory Education:** Combines visual, auditory, and interactive elements to enhance comprehension and retention.
- **Scalable and Modular:** Designed for future expansion, making it easy to add new subjects, learning modes, and additional features.
- **Real-Time Performance:** Optimized for smooth performance on AR-compatible devices with low latency and robust error handling.

## Technology Stack

- **Unity & C#:** Core development platform for creating and rendering AR experiences.
- **ARCore/ARFoundation:** For integrating AR capabilities on mobile devices.
- **Blender:** For 3D modeling and animation of the virtual teacher.
- **Google Text-to-Speech API:** Provides auditory feedback to users.
- **Gemini API:** Powers the AI-driven question-answering functionality.
- **Node.js & Express:** Backend framework for managing API requests and data processing.
- **Firebase:** Cloud-based database solution for secure data management and real-time updates.
- **Three.js (Optional):** Used for additional web-based AR visualization components, if needed.
